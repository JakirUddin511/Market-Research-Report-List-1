<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fluorination Reagents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electrophilic Fluorination Reagents</li><li>Nucleophilic Fluorination Reagents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fluorination reagents are classified into two main types: electrophilic and nucleophilic fluorination reagents. Electrophilic fluorination reagents, such as Selectfluor or N-fluorobenzenesulfonimide, introduce fluorine through electrophilic attack, facilitating the formation of carbon-fluorine bonds in various organic substrates. Conversely, nucleophilic fluorination reagents, like potassium fluoride or alkali metal fluorides, yield fluorine by donating a fluoride ion, often targeting electrophilic centers in compounds. Both types are crucial for synthesizing fluorinated chemicals with applications in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials science.</p></p>
