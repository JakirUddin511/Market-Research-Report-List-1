<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Economizers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fluid/ Water Side Economizer</li><li>Air Side Economizer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The economizer market primarily includes two types: fluid/water side economizers and air side economizers. Fluid/water side economizers utilize cool water to optimize cooling systems, often improving energy efficiency in HVAC applications. They draw on external water sources to pre-cool water before it enters chillers. In contrast, air side economizers use outside air to cool buildings directly, reducing reliance on mechanical cooling. Both types contribute to energy savings, sustainability, and enhanced indoor air quality in commercial and industrial settings.</p></p>
