<p><h1>Insights into Sandwich ELISA Market Size: Analysing Market Share, Trends, and Growth from 2024 to 2031</h1></p><p><strong>Sandwich ELISA Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Sandwich ELISA, or Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay, is a highly sensitive and specific immunoassay technique used to detect and quantify proteins, hormones, and other biomolecules in a sample. It involves two antibodies: a capture antibody that is immobilized on a plate to capture the target analyte, and a detection antibody that binds to the analyte to provide a measurable signal. This method is popular in clinical diagnostics, research laboratories, and biopharmaceutical industries due to its robustness and versatility.</p><p>The Sandwich ELISA market is anticipated to experience significant growth, driven by rising demand for diagnostic tools, advancements in antibody production, and an increasing prevalence of chronic diseases. Factors such as growing investments in biotechnology and pharmaceutical research, as well as the expansion of healthcare infrastructure in developing regions, are further contributing to this growth. Moreover, technological innovations aimed at enhancing assay sensitivity and reducing turnaround times are emerging as key trends. As the demand for rapid and accurate diagnostic solutions continues to rise, the Sandwich ELISA market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 3.80% during the forecast period, underscoring its vital role in modern diagnostics and research applications.</p></p>
