<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tardive Dyskinesia (TD) Treatment Drugs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Valbenazine</li><li>Deutetrabenazine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Tardive Dyskinesia (TD) treatment primarily includes drugs like Valbenazine and Deutetrabenazine. Valbenazine is approved for managing TD symptoms by selectively inhibiting the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), reducing dopamine overflow. Deutetrabenazine functions similarly but has a longer half-life due to its deuteration, allowing for a more stable dosing regimen. Both medications aim to mitigate involuntary movements associated with TD, improving patients’ quality of life while minimizing side effects commonly linked with antipsychotic treatments.</p></p>
