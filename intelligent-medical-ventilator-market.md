<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intelligent Medical Ventilator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-invasive Ventilator</li><li>Invasive Ventilator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Intelligent Medical Ventilator market comprises two primary types: non-invasive ventilators and invasive ventilators. Non-invasive ventilators assist patients without the need for intubation, using masks or nasal interfaces to improve breathing while minimizing discomfort and infection risk. In contrast, invasive ventilators require patients to be intubated, providing more controlled and effective respiratory support during severe medical conditions. Both types are essential for managing respiratory failure, but they cater to different patient needs and clinical scenarios within healthcare settings.</p></p>
