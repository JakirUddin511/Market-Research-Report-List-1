<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The TBM Sealants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tail Sealants</li><li>Main Drive Sealants</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The TBM sealants market is primarily divided into two categories: tail sealants and main drive sealants. Tail sealants are used to prevent water and soil ingress at the back of the tunnel boring machine (TBM), ensuring a secure excavation environment. In contrast, main drive sealants are located at the front, providing protection against external elements while facilitating smooth movement of the TBM. Both types play crucial roles in enhancing operational efficiency and ensuring the structural integrity of tunneling projects.</p></p>
