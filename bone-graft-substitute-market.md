<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bone Graft Substitute Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Autografts</li><li>Allografts</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The bone graft substitute market primarily includes two key types: autografts and allografts. Autografts involve harvesting bone tissue from the patient's own body, providing high compatibility and reduced risk of rejection. In contrast, allografts use bone tissue from a donor, typically obtained from cadaveric sources. Allografts offer the advantage of avoiding a second surgical site but may carry risks of disease transmission and immunogenic reactions. Together, these options cater to various orthopedic and reconstructive surgery needs, enhancing bone healing and regeneration.</p></p>
