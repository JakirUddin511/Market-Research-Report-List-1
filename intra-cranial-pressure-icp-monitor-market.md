<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intra-cranial pressure (ICP) monitor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-Invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The intracranial pressure (ICP) monitor market is segmented into invasive and non-invasive types. Invasive ICP monitoring involves the use of devices like ventriculostomy or fiberoptic catheters inserted directly into the cranial cavity, providing real-time pressure readings but carrying risks of infection. Non-invasive ICP monitoring, on the other hand, employs techniques like transcranial Doppler or MRI to estimate pressure without penetrating the skull, offering a safer alternative, albeit with potentially lower accuracy. Both types are crucial for managing neurological conditions.</p></p>
