<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Residential Solar Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Grid-Tied Solar System</li><li>Off Grid Solar System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The residential solar market consists of two primary types: grid-tied solar systems and off-grid solar systems. Grid-tied systems connect to the electric grid, allowing homeowners to use solar energy while drawing from the grid when needed, often benefiting from net metering. Off-grid systems, on the other hand, operate independently, requiring battery storage to provide energy during non-sunny periods, making them ideal for remote locations or those seeking energy independence. Each system offers distinct advantages based on energy needs and connectivity.</p></p>
