<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rebreather for Diving Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed Circuit</li><li>Semi-Closed</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In the diving market, rebreathers are classified into two main types: closed circuit and semi-closed circuit. Closed circuit rebreathers recycle exhaled gas, removing carbon dioxide and replenishing oxygen, allowing for extended dive times and reduced bubbles. Semi-closed circuit systems, on the other hand, expel a portion of the gas mixture, maintaining some fresh oxygen supply while still recycling the exhaled gas. Both systems enhance efficiency and underwater stealth, catering to different diving needs and preferences.</p></p>
